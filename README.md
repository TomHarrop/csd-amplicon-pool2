## amel_4.5

This was an attempt to run the genotyping pipeline on the old honeybee assembly (Amel_v4.5).
It doesn't work because the Csd region is not assembled properly.
There is a gap (string of Ns) between exons where the hypervariable region should be, and the predicted protein doesn't have the hypervariable AA sequence.
